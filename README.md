# crawlinks: a crawler that retrieves all indexed links from a website
```bash
git clone https://github.com/qsvtr/crawlinks.git
cd crawlinks/
npm install
node index.js -h
```
You can use it to verify if you have broken links ... or to get all the **indexed** links of a website :D

**TO DO:**
+ verify www.domain.com and domain.com to avoid repetitons (?)
+ respect the robots.txt file
